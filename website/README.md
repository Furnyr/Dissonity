## About

The official Dissonity website hosts documentation about the usage of the Unity package, development efforts and other internal implementations.

## Doxygen Reference

The Doxygen reference is generated using Ubuntu, so you may need to use a subsystem to test it locally.

Go to `../doxygen` and Run `doxygen` to generate the reference in `./public/ref`.
