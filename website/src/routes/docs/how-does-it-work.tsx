        Discord activities are applications that are executed inside the Discord client, and are available everywhere on Discord. 
        Under the hood, they are just <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe">Iframes</a> that
        load a website through the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/development-guides#activity-proxy-considerations">Discord Proxy</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unity supports building games using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/webgl.html">WebGL</a>, which allows them to run on the web. If
        all we wanted was to embed a Unity game inside Discord, we wouldn't really need anything else, but what makes activities fun is <b>interaction</b>. Things
        like playing with other users, seeing your name and avatar, sharing moments easily or being able to join the same lobby when clicking "Join activity".
      </p>

      <p>
        Discord provides an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discord/embedded-app-sdk">SDK</a> to communicate with the client from an activity, but it is a <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> package. This means that
        an activity that uses the official SDK needs to use a Node.js-based server, or at least depend on Node.js for the development process. But Dissonity gives you the option to not use Node.js.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why-use-dissonity">Why use Dissonity? <HashLink link="/docs/v2/how-does-it-work#why-use-dissonity" /></h2>

      <ul>
        <li>100% Coverage of the official SDK</li>
        <li>API Designed for Unity</li>
        <li>Easy testing</li>
        <li>Support for different backends</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Dissonity provides an integrated way to communicate with the Discord client â€” <Link to="/docs/v2/internals/hirpc">hiRPC</Link>. No need to install nothing using JavaScript, everything is included in your Unity project. You can use any backend you want, as long as it can handle <Link to="/docs/v2/development/authentication">authentication</Link>.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the most notable feature might be the testing environment, also known as <b>Mock Mode</b>. You don't need to compile and host your game each time you need to test something, you can
        simulate the Discord client in the editor. This significantly reduces development time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you want to try your game inside Discord, you just need to build the project for WebGL. Your build will include everything you need for your Discord activity, you just need to host the server.
