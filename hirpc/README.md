## About

This library can be included in the game build files. Allows communication between Discord, the JavaScript layer and your embedded application.

- Creates a connection with the Discord RPC
- Passes messages to the game build
- Exposes APIs to the JavaScript layer securely

## Developing

You may need to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

### 1. üõ†Ô∏è Build the library
```
pnpm build
```

### 2. üß© Add your build variables
```
pnpm variables
```

### 3. üîå Run the test server in `./www`

###### Test exposed functions in `./www/src/client`

```
cd ./www
pnpm start
```

### 4. üî¨ Use a tunnel to test inside the Discord client

If you're using [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-local-tunnel/#1-download-and-install-cloudflared):
```
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

## Continuous Integration

```
cd ..
act -j 'hirpc_tests'
```
