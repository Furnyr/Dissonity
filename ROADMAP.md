# Dissonity v2 development roadmap

Version 2 was first planned in April 15, 2024. The alpha phase started in September 26, 2024 and the beta is expected around February/March 2025.

Although it's impossible to estimate when it will be production-ready, there's a release plan:

## Dissonity v1

Make sure you install v1 from `https://github.com/Furnyr/Dissonity.git?path=/unity#v1` and *not* from the main branch. This way, you will be able to continue using v1 even after v2 is merged into the main branch.

Version 1 will keep receiving bug fixes, but not new features. It's highly encouraged to migrate to v2 once it's released since v1 will be deprecated in the future.

## Release plan

1. Alpha 5 is released
2. After testing, Beta 1 is released alongside @dissonity/hirpc-kit
3. Documentation starts rolling out at https://dissonity.dev
4. The Node.js example server is updated
5. READMEs and other repository files (like workflows) are done
6. Work with 3rd parties (Robo.js)

(...) Other beta releases

7. Testing (and unit testing)

After that, version 2 would be close to a release state. Of course, it's possible that there are other changes not covered here.
