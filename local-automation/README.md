## About

Scripts used for file management while developing Dissonity locally.

<ul>
    <li><b>move</b>: Moving files within the repository folder.</li>
    <li><b>pull</b>: Moving files from the repository to your local Unity project.</li>
    <li><b>sync</b>: Moving files from your local Unity project to the repository.</li>
</ul>

## Developing

You may need to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

### 0. üéÆ Prepare a Unity project

Create a Unity project using Unity 2021.3 or later. Then, create a folder named `LocalDissonity` in your `Assets`.

You can additionally right click your assets and select `Create > Dissonity > Development > Dev Dialogs Asset` to access C# local development utilities.

### 1. ‚öíÔ∏è Install dependencies

Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies.

### 2. üìã Set the project path

Rename `.example.env` to `.env` and copy the path to your Unity project in it.


## Working on the Unity package

Run this command to copy the Unity package to your `LocalDissonity` folder:

```
pnpm pull
```

If you are also working on TypeScript files, like hiRPC, read [Working on TypeScript modules](#working-on-typescript-modules).

Once you are done, use this command to bring back the changes in your local project to the repository:

```
pnpm sync
```

## Working on TypeScript modules

Update the modules as needed (e.g., `hirpc`). Then, to move the files to your local Unity project you can run:

```
pnpm build_all_and_pull
```

To build everything before moving the files to your project.

You can also manage each module individually:

```
# In the module folder
pnpm build
pnpm move

# In the local folder (here)
pnpm pull
```
