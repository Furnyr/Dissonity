## About

This package serves two functions:

- Passing the configuration from the game engine to the hiRPC
- Calling JS functions maintained by Discord

## Scripts

You may need to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

### üõ†Ô∏è Build utility files into `../hirpc/pkg`
```
pnpm build
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Add build variables for testing
```
pnpm variables
```

## Production

Build the utility files and don't update the variables, the files that must be included are documented in the hiRPC folder.

## Moving the files to Dissonity (Unity package)

You can move the resources (hiRPC, interface and utils) to the Unity folder once you are done working on them.

```
pnpm bundle
```
