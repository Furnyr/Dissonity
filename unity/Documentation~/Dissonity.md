### Unity package documentation

## Editor

### Right click menu (`Dissonity` > `Discord Bridge`)

Creates a DiscordBridge object, it must be within all the scenes that need to interact with the Embedded App SDK. You shouldn't modify this object manually.

It also has a "Dont Destroy On Load" option. If you use it, you should only place the object in your first scene.

## Overrides

You can set override values through the API class to test them without needing to run the game inside Discord. The overrides will only work while in the Unity editor and not once the game is exported.

All the current override values:

```
OverrideInstanceId
OverrideUserId
OverrideUserGlobal
OverrideUsername 
OverrideUserAvatar
OverrideHardwareAcceleration
OverrideUserLocale
```

## Namespace: `Dissonity`

- Classes representing Discord structures
- Classes representing data sent from the SDK
- Static Api class

Most of the classes from this package are only used to represent types that you ***receive***. The classes that are meant for creation purposes are suffixed `Builder`. Otherwise, you shouldn't create and send manually instantiated classes.

## Api class

You can use the methods from the Dissonity API in 3 ways:

1. Accessing the namespace (`Dissonity.Api.SomeMethod();`)
2. Importing the namespace (`using Dissonity; ... Api.SomeMethod();`)
3. Importing the static API methods (recommended) (`using static Dissonity.Api; ... SomeMethod();`)

> Importing the static API methods won't import the classes, so if you need to access a builder (like ActivityBuilder) you could import the namespace too.

## `Sub<Event>`

All the methods prefixed with "Sub" subscribe to an event and accept two arguments:

1. [Delegate] : A listener function that will be called when the event occurs
2. [Boolean]\(optional): Defaults to false. A boolean that when false indicates to add the listener and subscribe to the DiscordSDK instance and otherwise just adds the listener. Useful when you want to add another listener function but the event is already subscribed to.

- Required scopes: [Depends on the event](https://discord.com/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk#sdk-events)
- Returns: void

All the currently supported subscription methods:
```
SubVoiceStateUpdate
SubSpeakingStart
SubSpeakingStop
SubActivityLayoutModeUpdate
SubOrientationUpdate
SubCurrentUserUpdate
SubThermalStateUpdate
SubActivityInstanceParticipantsUpdate
```

##

## `Unsub<Event>`

All the methods prefixed with "Unsub" remove a subscription to an event and accept two arguments:

1. [Delegate] : The listener function to be removed
2. [Boolean]\(optional): Defaults to false. A boolean that when false indicates to remove the listener and unsubscribe to the DiscordSDK instance and otherwise just removes the listener. Useful when you want to remove a listener but will need to add another soon.

(No required scopes)

- Returns: void

All the currently supported unsubscription methods:
```
UnsubVoiceStateUpdate
UnsubSpeakingStart
UnsubSpeakingStop
UnsubActivityLayoutModeUpdate
UnsubOrientationUpdate
UnsubCurrentUserUpdate
UnsubThermalStateUpdate
UnsubActivityInstanceParticipantsUpdate
```

## `DissonityLog`

You will need to debug your activity looking at the browser dev console. To (hopefully) save you some time, you can use DissonityLog instead of Debug.Log.

- Arguments:
- - [Object] : Acts as the first argument of Debug.Log

- Returns: void
